    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p><h2>Environmental sustainability</h2>is a conservation concept which is the meeting of services and resources of 
      present and future generations without affecting the health of the ecosystems that provide them. 
      The principles for Strategy of environmental sustainability are given below as: <br />

      1.Biodiversity conservation: this is the preservation of biodiversity and energy resources. <br />
      2.Social needs: the availability of basic needs, products, and services for present and future generations. 
      Support local employment, fair trade and environmental attributes of raw material. <br />
      3.Regenerative capacity: protect the depletion of natural resources and keep the harvest rate of renewable resources within 
      the capacity of regeneration. <br />
      4.Reuse, recycling: support the reuse, recycling practices to reduce waste, emissions, and cost and improve product efficiency. <br />
      5.Limitations of nonrenewable resources and waste generation: the human economic system should be within the carrying capacity, 
      the emissions should be within the assimilative capacity of the ecosystem, prioritize low-impact transportation, 
      and effective decisions with consideration of environmental quality</p>

    Environmental Sustainability
Environmental sustainability defines a boundary for us to satisfy our current needs without anyway compromising the quality of 
environment/ecosystem so that it remains equally capable of supporting the future generations too.
This can be attained by coordinated efforts for achieving higher nutrient and water use efficiency along with pest control through 
integrated approaches. It is herculean task to accomplish the targets of complete environmentally sustainable agriculture due to 
overlapping or conflicting balances among profitable and environmental goals however even a partial transition towards the 
environmental sustainability can prove to be vital in making green production strategy a huge success. The various targets to be 
followed in order to achieve environmental sustainability include: <br />

<h1>Enhanced Yield Potential</h1> 
The target of environmental sustainability can be achieved by enhancing the yield within the domain of available arable land
 without eyeing to disturb the low yielding irrigation scarce marginal lands (Ruttan, 1999; Young, 1999). Many major production 
 areas of rice in east and southeast Asia which are mostly the early adopters of green-revolution technologies tend to show stagnant 
 yield due to routine or less diverse cereal production systems and possess high threat of disease and pest susceptibility 
 (Cassman and Dobermann, 2001). This problem of stagnant yield potential or yield gap among the highly exploited and less 
 exploited areas of rice production signifies the need to adopt innovative technologies to bridge the yield gap. 
 In order to make sustainable agriculture a success, the yield potential of various staple crops need to be boosted like the wheat
  by the deployment of appropriate breeding techniques and technological interventions. <br />
